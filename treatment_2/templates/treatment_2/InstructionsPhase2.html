    <h2>Phase 2</h2>
    <p>
        You continue playing the same game. Here is some more information about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every coin you invest, you produce one good which is sold.
        The price of each good is determined by <code>P=(3000/Q)-10</code>, where <code>Q</code>
        is the total number of coins invested by you and your two counterparts.
        Your earnings in a period are.
        <strong class="text-info">"your coins invested" times P, plus 100 coins</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the game proceeds, from now on, you will learn after each period,
        how many coins you and the counterparts invested, and how much you
        earned last period as a result of your, and your counterpartsâ€™, investments.
    </p>
    <p>Phase 2 of the experiment contains another 20 periods.</p>
