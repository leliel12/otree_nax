Hey juan,

Here is some more details:

Sequence of experiment:

1. instructions.
2. After the instructions, each period, there will just be one screen where they make the decision
3. after they submit answer, the waiting screen (waiting for others to make decision in their own group),
4.  and then a screen to announce the result of that period.


Then the next period will start, i.e. repeat 2.,3.4. ...

Til next treatment.

Wanna skype about this?

Best,
heinrich

We can just follow Friedman et al. In terms of screen layout and sequence. What do you mean test of the experiment?

Could you add in the Dropbox document and send to me via email? I'm in China and Dropbox is blocked. I'll then add whatever else is needed and edit. Thank you!

Best,

Peiran
