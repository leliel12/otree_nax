        <strong>Welcome to the experiment!</strong> This is an economics
        experiment about decision-making. If you pay close attention to these
        instructions, you can earn a significant sum of money, which will be paid
        to you in cash at the end of the last period.

        Please remain silent and do not look at other participants' screens.
        If you have any questions, or need assistance of any kind, please raise
        your hand and we will come to you. If you disrupt the experiment by talking,
        laughing, etc., you may be asked to leave and may not be paid. We expect
        and appreciate your cooperation today. There are two parts of your reward
        in this experiment:

    <ol>
        <li>
            {% blocktrans %}A show-up fee of{% endblocktrans %} <strong class="text-info">100 {% trans 'points' %}</strong>,
            {% blocktrans %}which is independent from your decisions in the experiment, and{% endblocktrans %}
        </li>
        <li>{% blocktrans %}a payment that depends on your decisions in the experiment, which will be explained next.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>{% blocktrans %}The Basic Idea{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        The experiment will be divided into a number of periods and in each period you
        will be anonymously matched with two other players via the computer.
        In each period you and your counterparts will select strategies and at the end of
        the period the combination of your and your counterparts' strategies will determine your
        earnings for the period.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        Right now we do not tell you exactly how earnings are determined but here are a few facts:
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>{% blocktrans %}Your earnings in each period depend entirely on your strategy and your counterparts' strategies, and nothing else.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktrans %}The function that determines your earnings will not change over the course of the experiment. That is, if you and your counterparts use the same strategies at time A as at time B, you both will all have the same earnings at time A as at time B.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktrans %}Your earnings are symmetric with your counterparts'. In particular, if you and your counterparts all choose the same strategy, then you all will earn the same amount{% endblocktrans %}</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>{% blocktrans %}Payment{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        The experiment will last 60 periods. At the end of the experiment,
        we will randomly select one period and pay you according to your earnings
        in that period. Any period may be selected, so please do your best in
        all decisions. The total number of coins you earned in that period will
        be converted into real money at an exchange rate of {% endblocktrans %}<code>{{1|c}} = ${{Constants.ratio}}</code>.
