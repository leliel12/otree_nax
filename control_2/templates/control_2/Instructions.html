    <h2>Phase 1</h2>
    <p>
        Each period, you decide how much to invest. You have a fixed budget of
        100 coins each period, from which you freely choose any nonnegative
        integer amount (between 0 and 100 coins). Your budget comes new each
        period. As the game proceeds, you will learn after each period how
        many coins you earned last period as a result of your, and your
        counterparts, investment decisions.
