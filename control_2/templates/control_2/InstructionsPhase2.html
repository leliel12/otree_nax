    <h2>Phase 2</h2>
    <p>
        You continue playing the same game. Here is some more information about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every coin you invest, you produce one good which is sold.
        The price of each good is determined by <code>P=(3000/Q)-10</code>,
        where <code>Q</code> is the total number of coins invested by you and
        your two counterparts. Your earnings in a period are
        <strong class="text-info">"your coins invested" times P, plus 100 coins</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        As the game proceeds, you will learn after each period, how many coins
        you and your counterparts invested, and how much you and your
        counterparts earned last period as a result of your, and your
        counterpartsâ€™, investments. You will play the game for another 40 periods.
